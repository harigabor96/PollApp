# PollApp
This project is a back-end, thin client project that I made with Spring Boot (Java) to learn the MVC pattern. It's a simple web app that lets the user create polls (admin) and vote (user) for them. It also comes with its own database tier, which I wrote in T-SQL. 

It was a first-time project with both Java and the MVC pattern, but I think it turned out pretty nicely in the end, so I decided to make it public.
